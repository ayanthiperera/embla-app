The Logo will be more towards dark colors since this web app relates with movies and movie banners are usually colorful.

# Page 1

**Click on first tile to show/hide details**

# Page 2

# Suggestions
1. According to the given wireframe, if the user scrolls down and clicks on a movie,it has to be scrolled up to see the details of the movie. So I would suggest it is better to display the detail section right next to the certain movie card or use a pop up window.

2. In page two(suggested page design), the movie's detail box should render in three different locations dynamically according to the device's width. Ex:
   - Desktop view - render after five columns of view cards.
   - Tab view - render after three columns of view cards.
   - Mobile view - render after a column of view cards.
